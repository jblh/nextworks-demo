# Blocks Quickstart

This document explains the Blocks kit: prebuilt UI sections, templates and core UI primitives included in this repository. The Blocks kit is intended to be a non-invasive copyable kit (shadCN-style) you can install into any Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind project.

> **Alpha note**
> Other kits (Auth Core, Forms, Data) are currently tested and supported on top of a default Blocks install.
> For the smoothest experience, install **Blocks first** in your app before adding other kits.

> If you are using the `nextworks` CLI in your own app, you can install this Blocks kit by running:
>
> ```bash
> npx nextworks@latest add blocks --sections --templates
> ```
>
> This installs **core UI primitives, sections, and page templates**, so the example templates work out of the box. The CLI will copy files into your project under `components/`, `app/templates/`, `lib/`, and `public/` as described below.

What’s included

- Page templates (composed from sections):
  - app/templates/productlaunch
  - app/templates/saasdashboard
  - app/templates/digitalagency
- Reusable UI sections: components/sections/\* (Navbar, Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, Contact, Footer, etc.)
- Core UI primitives: components/ui/\* (Button, Input, Card, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Theme toggle/selector, Form primitives)
- Theme helpers and presets: components/PresetThemeVars in each template and lib/themes.ts
- Global styles: app/globals.css and optional theme variables in each template's PresetThemeVars file
- Sample placeholder assets: public/placeholders/\*

Where to look

- Templates:
  - app/templates/productlaunch/page.tsx (productlaunch template)
  - app/templates/saasdashboard/page.tsx (saasdashboard template)
  - app/templates/digitalagency/page.tsx (digital agency template)
- Sections:
  - components/sections/\*.tsx
- UI primitives and form building blocks:
  - components/ui/button.tsx
  - components/ui/input.tsx
  - components/ui/label.tsx
  - components/ui/card.tsx
  - components/ui/textarea.tsx
  - components/ui/select.tsx
  - components/ui/checkbox.tsx
  - components/ui/switch.tsx
  - components/ui/form/\* (Form, FormField, FormItem, FormControl, FormLabel, FormMessage, FormDescription)
- Theme and providers:
  - components/theme-provider.tsx
  - components/enhanced-theme-provider.tsx
  - lib/themes.ts

Minimal steps to render a template locally

1. Install dependencies and run the dev server:

   npm install
   npm run dev

2. Open the productlaunch template in your browser:

   http://localhost:3000/templates/productlaunch

3. The templates use global styles (app/globals.css). No environment variables are required for Blocks-only usage.

How to adopt / override template pieces

- Slots & component overrides
  - Each template composes small sections from components/sections/\*.tsx. To override a section, copy the desired section file into your project (or replace the import) and update props or classNames.
  - Example: to override the Navbar, copy components/sections/Navbar.tsx into your app and update the markup or styles. The template imports Navbar from the components directory.

- Styling and utility classes
  - Tailwind is used across components. Prefer adding or modifying Tailwind utility classes on the exported component or pass className props (many components accept className).

- Theme variables and PresetThemeVars
  - Each template has a PresetThemeVars component/file (e.g., app/templates/productlaunch/PresetThemeVars.tsx) that injects CSS variables for theme presets.
  - To change default palette or add presets, edit the template PresetThemeVars and lib/themes.ts.
  - Theme providers are implemented in components/theme-provider.tsx and components/enhanced-theme-provider.tsx — wrap your app with these if you extract blocks into another project.

Import examples

- Import a primitive in your code:

  import Button from "@/components/ui/button";
  import { Form, FormField } from "@/components/ui/form/form"; // path depends on your project alias

- Use a section in a page:

  import Navbar from "@/components/sections/Navbar";

  export default function Page() {
  return (
  <>
  <Navbar />
  <main>{/_ ... _/}</main>
  </>
  );
  }

Public assets and placeholders

- The templates reference placeholder images in public/placeholders/. If you copy templates to another project, copy the referenced assets (public/placeholders/gallery/\*) or replace with your own images.

Simple Blocks kit manifest (for internal CLI packaging)

> This section is for maintainers of the `nextworks` CLI. You don’t need this if you’re just installing Blocks into your own app.

Use this manifest to drive a CLI copy step: it enumerates the primary files that make up the Blocks kit. Adjust paths if your CLI uses a different base.

- Suggested internal path: cli/kits/blocks/manifest.json

Notes & recommendations

- Blocks are self-contained and do not require Prisma or NextAuth. If your user only needs Blocks, the CLI should copy these files and add a brief README instructing the user to import the theme provider in app/layout.tsx and ensure app/globals.css is present.
- Consider adding an examples folder demonstrating how to swap PresetThemeVars and override a section component.

---

If you'd like, I can:

- Create the CLI manifest file at cli/kits/blocks/manifest.json using the JSON above, or
- Create a short example that demonstrates overriding Navbar and changing PresetThemeVars.

Tell me which of the above to create next.
