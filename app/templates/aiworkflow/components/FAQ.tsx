          question: "What kinds of coding tasks can the agent handle?",
          answer:
                        "Teams use MergeBeacon AI for bug fixes, refactors, routine maintenance, release prep, and other repeatable code changes.",

        },
        {
          question: "How do reviews and approvals work?",
          answer:
            "You define the rules once. The agent keeps moving on low-risk work and pauses only when a review or approval is required.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can the agent use our codebase and docs?",
          answer:
            "Yes. It can read repo files, docs, and internal notes so changes stay grounded in current project context.",
        },
        {
          question: "Will we be able to audit every change?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Each run records reads, edits, approvals, and output so teams can trace what changed and why.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do we need engineering support to start?",
          answer:
            "Most teams start with a few high-signal tasks, then expand the agent into more of the codebase as confidence grows.",
        },
        {
          question: "Which tools can it connect to?",
          answer:
            "The template story assumes common tools like GitHub, docs, issue trackers, CI, and chat, with more connectors added as needed.",
